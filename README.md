# ![Hello](https://github.com/gmeben/gmeben/raw/master/assets/greeting.svg)

I generally like to follow [the Angular contributor guidelines](https://github.com/angular/angular/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md#type) by prefacing my commit messages with one of the following:

* **build**: Changes that affect the build system or external dependencies used
* **feat**: A new feature
* **fix**: A bug fix
* **refactor**: A code change that neither fixes a bug nor adds a feature
* **style**: Code changes that do not affect the meaning of the code
* **test**: Adding missing tests or correcting existing tests
